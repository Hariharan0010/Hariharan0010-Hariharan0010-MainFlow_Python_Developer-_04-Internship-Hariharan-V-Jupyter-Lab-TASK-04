# Main-Flow-Services-and-Technologies-Task4

## Overview

This repository contains the work I completed for Task 4 of my Python Developer internship at **Main Flow Services and Technologies**. In this task, I developed a simple Basic calculator using Python. The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Project Description

The goal of this task was to design and implement a Basic calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations interactively. The calculator is designed with a user-friendly interface and includes input validation to handle errors and ensure predictable behavior.

## Learning Objectives

- **User Interface Design:** Create an intuitive command-line interface using Python's input function.
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Implement functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Input Validation:** Ensure the calculator handles invalid inputs gracefully and provides appropriate feedback to the user.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python 3.x**
- **`calculator.py`**: The Python script for the Basic calculator.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the script in this repository, you need to have Python installed on your machine. There are no additional dependencies, so you can run the script directly.

### Running the Calculator

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dj-gamer007/python-developer-internship.git
   cd python-developer-internship/Task4
   ```

2. **Run the Script:**

   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

3. **Using the Calculator:**

   - The calculator will prompt you to enter two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
   - The calculator will then display the result of the operation.
   - If an invalid input is provided, the calculator will display an error message and prompt you to try again.


## Key Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use command-line interface with clear prompts.
- **Input Validation:** Handles errors such as division by zero and invalid operation choices.
